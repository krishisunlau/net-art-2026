<h3>Tell me the duck story</h3>
<h4>Bum bum bum, ba-dum ba-dum</h4>
<p>A duck walked up to a lemonade stand
    And he said to the man, running the stand
    "Hey! (Bum bum bum)</p>

<h1>Got any grapes?</h1>

The man said "No, we just sell lemonade <br>
    But it’s cold and it's fresh, and it’s all home-made. <br>
    Can I get you a glass?" <br>
    The duck said “I’ll pass.”
  <p>
    Then he waddled away, waddle waddle
    'Til the very next day, bum bum bum bum bum ba-dum</p>

    <br>

<em>When the duck walked up to the lemonade stand
    And he said to the man, running the stand
    "Hey! (Bum bum bum)</em>

<br>

<h1><strong>Got any grapes?</strong></h1>

<ol>
    <li>The man said "No, like I said yesterday</li>
    <li>We just sell lemonade. Okay?</li>
    <li>Why not give it a try?"</li>
    <li>The duck said "Goodbye."</li>
  </ol>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Then he waddled away, waddle waddle</li>
    <li>Then he waddled away, waddle waddle</li>
    <li>Then he waddled away, waddle waddle</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong> 'Til the very next day, bum bum bum bum bum ba-dum</strong></p>
