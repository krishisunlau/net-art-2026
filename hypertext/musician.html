    <h2 style="color: #FFD700; font-size: 2.5em; letter-spacing: 4px;">STREET MUSIC</h2>
    
    <p style="font-size: 1.15em; color: #ffffff;">You walk up to the crowd of people forming around this young musician. He played his saxaphone with such grace and you get lost in the slow tunes.  </p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 1.15em; color: #ffffff;"> An old man in the crowd is standing next to you, also appreciating the music. He starts a conversation and you happily converse with him about music.   </p>
        
    <p style="font-size: 1.15em; color: #ffffff;"> He then tells you about a little music cafe in the neighborhood that does live music in the evenings and suggests you go. Unfortunately, he has to take his leave but strongly suggests visiting the cafe.</p>
    
    <p style="font-size: 1.15em; color: #FFEB3B;">What do you do?</p>
